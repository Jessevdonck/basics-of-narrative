      "Daring captain of a small pirate crew that targets elite airships. Quick-tempered, clever, and impossible to intimidate.",
    fullBio:
      "Aira roams the skies with a ragtag crew scavenging parts, technology, and anything they can sell. Though she plays the outlaw, her crimes target only the wealthy industrial elite, never the working class. She hides her origins, but her knowledge of old ships suggests she once belonged among higher society before turning rogue. Aira values freedom above all, fiercely protective of her crew, especially the stowaway child Glitch, who tests her patience just as often as she saves it.",

    fullBio:
      "Vorpus lost his tail in a workplace ‘accident’ covered up by industrial elites. Since then, he has made it his mission to expose the powerful and dismantle systems that protect them. Pragmatic, intense, and willing to break the law to uphold it, Vorpus interrogates suspects with psychological precision. In the investigation of Vernan Creel’s murder, he suspects everyone, especially those who have reason to hate industrial society, such as servants, scavengers, and rebels.",

Vorpus blackmails him into helping with the investigation after discovering his illegal firearm and connections. Cold humor hides deeply rooted anger shaped by class discrimination and a tragic history tied to industrial exploitation. Xander smokes too much, trusts nearly no one, and quietly hates being noticed.",

    fullBio:
      "Working as a private servant aboard luxury airships, the Water Servant endures daily humiliation. The elite treat him like part of the furniture—making him perfectly placed to notice what others can’t. He despised Vernan Creel long before the murder, and though he appears obedient, resentment simmers beneath his calm exterior. When the body is discovered, he panics for the first time, realizing that silence has turned into complicity.",

Brilliant with mechanical scraps and fearless in chaos, the kid makes everything either go amazingly right or catastrophically wrong. Terrified of heights yet living on an airship, Glitch survives by improvisation, petty theft, and help from her pet rat Taara. While comedic in nature, she witnesses the murder at a pivotal moment, making her an unpredictable wildcard in the investigation.",

He admires the unregulated lifestyle of air pirates and forms a risky friendship with Aira’s crew. His charm is disarming, but he hides deep internal conflict and a tendency toward self-destruction. Cassian is the first to see the murdered body alongside the Water Servant, placing him between two worlds: the exploited and the exploiters. He may know more about the weapon used than he dares admit.",
